BMSim simulator

  the core of the simulator is an event driven simulator. 
  the event with minimum time in the events array is executed then the current time of
  the simulator is updated to event's time.
  in the while true, there are some if conditions that check the events and do some works for executing each event.
  after executing each event, this event creates a new event, and the new event with its time
  is added to the events' array.
