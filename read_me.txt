1- set the settings in the initializer.py file
2- run the event_driven.py file
3- wait until the simulation finished
4- run the performance_analyzer.py file for calculating
PDR, Latency, burst packet loss and energy consumption in the network
--------------------------------------------
--for plugging in static models and using static algorithms in the network design time you can use the initializer.py file
--for plugging in dynamic models and using dynamic algorithms in the network run-time you can use the Network_Updater.py file
--for parameters adjustment in the network run-time, you can use the Network_Updater.py file 

----------------------------------------------------
detail of the log files is explained in the file help_log.txt
