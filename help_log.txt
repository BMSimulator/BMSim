the BMSim simulator creates some log files during the simulation. 
In continuing, the content of each column in the log files is expressed.
In the first line, the name of the log file is expressed, 
In the next lines content of each column is specified.   

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
for calculating energy consumption in the network the energy.log is used. 

In continuing, the content of each column in this log file is specified.

source node    scanning time    switching time    transmitting time    sleeping time 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

if TOTAL_LOG = 1, there are log files as many as the number of nodes. The name of each log file is the node number. 
the operations of each node with packet characteristics are logged in each node's log file. 
there is a keyword at the beginning of each line that determines the node operation. In continuing, we explain them.


(relay) ----> the node relays a packet, the contents of the columns are the characteristics of this packet.

(main)  ----> the node receives a packet, the contents of the columns are the characteristics of this packet.

(heartbeat)  ---> the node receives a heartbeat packet, the contents of the columns are the characteristics of this packet.
	
(generate) ---> the node generates a data packet, the contents of the columns are the characteristics of this packet.

(heartbeat generate) ---> the node generates a heartbeat packet, the contents of the columns are the characteristics of this packet. 

(advertise) ---> the node advertises a data packet, the contents of the columns are the characteristics of this packet.

In continuing, the content of each column in log files is specified. 


(relay)    Advertising node    source node    receiving time    squence number    generation time    TTL    buffer len 

(main)    source node    squence number    generation time    destination node    receiving time

(heartbeat)    source node    squence number    generation time    destination node    receiving time    minimum hop    maximum hop

(generate)    source node    generation time    destination node    squence number

(heartbeat generate)    source node    generation time    destination node    squence number

(advertise)    advertising node    advertising time    source node   squence number      
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

if TOTAL_LOG = 0, the main characteristics of packets for calculating performance metrics are logged in the network_detail.log. 

In continuing, the content of each column in this log file is specified.

source node    destination node    receiving time    squence number    generation time
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

if TOTAL_LOG = 1, all operations in the network, will be logged in the detail.log file
